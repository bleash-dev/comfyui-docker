echo "🔄 Migration Strategy:"
echo "  1. New uploads use per-venv structure: /venv_chunks/{venv_name}/"
echo "  2. Legacy restoration checks /venv_chunks/ for backwards compatibility"
echo "  3. Legacy chunks are cleaned up after successful new-structure upload"
echo "  4. Each venv is handled independently for better reliability"

echo ""
echo "💾 Storage Benefits:"
echo "  ✅ Independent venv syncing (partial failures don't affect other venvs)"
echo "  ✅ Better parallelization (each venv can be processed separately)"
echo "  ✅ Cleaner organization (each venv has its own S3 'folder')"
echo "  ✅ Easier debugging (can inspect individual venv uploads)"
echo "  ✅ Backwards compatibility (legacy single venv still works)"

echo ""
echo "🛠️ Implementation Details:"
echo "  - Upload: Each venv in /venv/{name} → s3://.../venv_chunks/{name}/"
echo "  - Download: Check new structure first, fallback to legacy, then traditional archive"
echo "  - Cleanup: Remove legacy chunks after successful new-structure upload"
echo "  - Verification: Each venv is verified independently after restoration"
